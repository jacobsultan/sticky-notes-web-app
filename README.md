# This is a little project I worked on to make a functioning notes app website. I had lots of experience with back end development but wanted to work on my full stack skills. After following guides online for a couple of weeks, and learning a so much in them I decided it best to start building to further my learnings. I decided to stick to vanilla html, css and javascript all of which I hadn't used before, alongside flask. 

I found it surprisingly enjoyable and loved sticking all these different working pieces together and realising that I should've planned them all in advance! The formating using css I didn't perfect as I thought it was about time to move onto another project.
