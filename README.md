This is a little project I worked on to make a functioning notes app website. I had lots of experience with back end development but wanted to work on my full stack skills. After following guides online for a couple of weeks, I decided it best to start building to further my learnings. I decided to stick to vanilla html, css and javascript, all of which I hadn't used before, alongside flask. 

I found it surprisingly enjoyable and loved sticking all these different working pieces together and realising that I should've spent more time planning them all in advance! The formatting using css I didn't perfect as I thought it was about time to move onto another project.
